Helpful hints on digesting the barnes data....

1.  Place all the CNV files into one folder.
2.  Open up barnes2struct3.m
3.  change the path to the appropriate folder.
4.  Save and then run by typing barnes2struct3!
5.  You get two output workspaces....raw and CTD structure data. 
6.  barnes20031118.mat is automatically loaded into the workspace.
7.  You need to determine the size of the p, s and t matrices.  (rows, columns)
8.  Run barneyfilt.m on the structure to grid the data.
9.  The output barnes matrix is now gridded.
10.  Graph using ctdmultiplot5(barnes, col)  where col is the column you want to look at.
