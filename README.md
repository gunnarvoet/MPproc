# MPproc
MP processing toolbox (Matlab)

To process a new MP deployment copy [templates/MP_processing_worksheet.m](templates/MP_processing_worksheet.m) to your data directory and start from there.

The toolbox should contain all functions necessary to run the basic processing.

Despiking and CTDstruct were not adopted to new and modified routines and will probably not work out of the box. However, they should work after minor modifications as the structure of the output data has not changed.

Tilt correction for FSI ACM is now integrated. Use with caution as this has not been tested yet.

Happy processing!
