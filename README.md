# MPproc
MP processing toolbox (Matlab)

To process a new MP deployment copy templates/MP_processing_worksheet.m to your data directory and start from there.

The toolbox should contain all functions necessary to run the basic processing.

Despiking and CTDstruct were not adopted to new and modified routines and will probably not work out of the box.
